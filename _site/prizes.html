			<h1>Judging and Prizes</h1>

<p>Teams will have an opportunity to present their applications on Sunday evening to the audience and a panel of judges representing sponsors as well as Rice professors.</p>

<p>We will not judge code quality or style. However, it is recommended that you write clear and readable code to enable your team to work more efficiently.</p>

<p>1st ($150/member), 2nd ($100/member), and 3rd ($50/member) places will be judged with regards to UI, functionality, and utility.</p>

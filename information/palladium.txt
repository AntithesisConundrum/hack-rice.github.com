Mission statement
-
Based in Houston, Texas, Palladium Consulting is a boutique software consulting firm with over 14 years’ experience building bespoke scientific and economic applications for technology leaders.

We like to tackle hard problems, design new systems, take apart old ones, use the best tools for the job, and build the tools that aren’t invented yet.

We like to operate at scale, enabled by a clear grasp of computing and systems architecture fundamentals.

Our principals have deep experience in databases, computation, visualization and product strategy. We deliver impactful research and development to large, sophisticated companies.

  <h2>What is Hack Rice?</h2>
  Hack Rice is Rice University's annual hackathon event. Participants trade their sleep for a weekend and join a team to create a project - typically software - in an environment optimized for creativity. At the end of the event, the participants demonstrate their projects to fellow hackers, visitors, and a panel of judges. The event is hosted by the <a href='http://csclub.rice.edu'>Rice Computer Science Club</a>.

  <h2>How it all started</h2>
  <p>Unsatisfied with the lack of self-driven projects by computer science majors at Rice, a group of 5 undergraduates: Waseem Ahmad, Dennis Qian, Joan Chao, Frank Salinas, and Sal Testa decided to organize the first hackathon at Rice. With the support of the Rice Computer Science department, Rice School of Engineering, our amazing sponsors, and enthusiastic community of students, we successfully held our first hackathon during Spring 2012 with over 50 participants including undergradutes, graduates, and alumni accross various disciplines.</p>
  <p>This year, we are hosting our first region wide hackathon and invite nearby schools to join us!</p>

<h1>Rules & Prizes</h1>
<p>Hack Rice organizers reserve the right to modify the contest rules as they see necessary and make judgments on issues not explicitly address in this document.</p>

<h2>Application & Attendance</h2>
<p>Any full-time or part-time US university student is eligible to apply to Hack Rice 2014. Upon acceptance, the student must arrange their own travel to the event. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis. Rice alumni are eligible to attend the event to hack or mentor other students. However, alumni's submissions will not be eligible for prizes.</p>

<h2>Hackathon</h2>
<p>Hack Rice will officially kick off at 12:00 PM on Saturday, January 25, 2014. We will provide tables, power strips, food, caffeine, and hourly raffle prizes to keep you awake. To be eligible for prizes, your submission must:
<ul>
  <li>be created by team members entirely between the Saturday kick off and Sunday deadline</li>
  <li>be created by a team with at most 5 members</li>
  <li>External Resources: Participants may use external resources (online resources, reference books, help from mentors, etc), but the material of the submission must be created by team members alone.</li>
  <li>Third Party Libraries and APIs: Third party libraries and APIs are permitted if they publicly available and free to use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Each team is allowed to make a single submission by the deadline. The submission process will be explained during the event and updated over here. In general, the following items will be expected for the submission:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Team name and members, including contact information.</li>
  <li>Application name and its description and purpose.</li>
  <li>URL to live demo of the application if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Demos</h2>
<p>Following submission, everyone will convene to a common location to present their hacks. Each team will have 2 minutes (strict) for the demo and another 2 minutes to answer questions raised by the judges.</p>

<p>We discourage the use of slides and highly recommend that you rehearse your presentation. <strong>2 minutes is a very short time!</strong></p>

<h2>Judging</h2>
<p>Teams will have an opportunity to present their applications on Sunday evening to the audience and a panel of judges representing sponsors as well as Rice professors. We will not judge code quality or style. However, it is recommended that you write clear and readable code to enable your team to work more efficiently.</p>

<h2>Prizes</h2>
<p>The following prizes will be awarded and split among the winning teams by judging the following criteria: innovation & creativity, technical complexity, and polish.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st Place: $3000</li>
  <li>2nd Place: $1500</li>
  <li>3rd Place: $500</li>
</ul>

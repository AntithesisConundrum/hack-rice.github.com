<h1 id="hackricesite">HackRice Site</h1>

<p>This is a Jekyll + Github pages site. Pushing to the repository on the <code>master</code> branch compiles the site and pushes it live. If developing non-live changes, don&#8217;t push to <code>master</code>!</p>

<h2 id="buildingthesite">Building the Site</h2>

<p>The site is built upon Jekyll, a static site generator. Install Jekyll via ruby gem. There&#8217;s a good installation guide <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">here</a>. You might have to update ruby or several other dependencies as well.</p>

<p>To test locally, start the server. Run <code>jekyll serve --watch</code> at the root directory of the codebase. The site will be hosted on <code>http://localhost:4000/</code> (there&#8217;s a chance your port could be different).</p>

<p>Jekyll will now compile the site any time a change is made to a file in this directory. These changes compile static files that can be found in the <code>_site</code> directory.</p>

<p>To push changes live, simply push the <code>master</code>. Github automatically compiles the site and makes the changes live!</p>

<h2 id="sass">SASS</h2>

<p>The design for the site was built using SASS, a markup language that compiles down to CSS. It&#8217;s really awesome. <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Check out the documentation</a> for details on how to install and compile the SCSS files.</p>

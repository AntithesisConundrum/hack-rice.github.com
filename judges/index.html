        <h2>Stephen Wong - Rice University professor</h2>
        <p>
            Dr. Stephen Wong is a physicist and computer scientist who, as a Howard Hughes Fellow, received his Ph.D. in experimental solid state physics from M.I.T. in 1988 and worked at Bell Labs with to-be-Nobel Laureate Steven Chu and Hughes Research Labs on high temperature superconductors and engineered bandgap materials before entering academia. In the last 20 years, Dr. Wong has taught physics, mathematics and computer science. He has published numerous papers and run many seminars on object-oriented programming and design and C.S. pedagogy. At Rice, he pioneered COMP 410, an experientially-driven, discovery-learning process software engineering course where students are placed in realistic software engineering situations that require solutions using state-of-the-art design, information management and project management skills.

        <h2>Brandon Wallace - Palladium Consulting</h2>
        <p>
            Brandon Wallace attended Rice when it was affordable and has spent over two decades designing and implementing software systems for the finance and energy sectors. He has been with Palladium Consulting since 2008, where he is both an exceptionally creative high level architect and a tenacious tunnel rat coder, capable of designing clever, delightful systems and ruthlessly subduing less clever ones. He's been known to hack on games and build bots in his spare time, with hundreds of thousands of people downloading his mods and patches.
